<p><font size="4">  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; Manilkara zapota, commonly known as sapodilla , sapota, chikoo, naseberry, or nispero[1] is a long-lived, evergreen tree native to southern Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.[2] An example natural occurrence is in coastal Yucatán in the Petenes mangroves ecoregion, where it is a subdominant plant species. It was introduced to the Philippines during Spanish colonization. It is grown in large quantities in India, Pakistan, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp;Sapodilla can grow to more than 30 m (98 ft) tall with an average trunk diameter of 1.5 m (4.9 ft). The average height of cultivated specimens, however, is usually between 9 and 15 m (30 and 49 ft) with a trunk diameter not exceeding 50 cm (20 in) It is wind-resistant and the bark is rich in a white, gummy latex called chicle. The ornamental leaves are medium green and glossy. They are alternate, elliptic to ovate, 7-15 cm (2.8-5.9 in) long, with an entire margin. The white flowers are inconspicuous and bell-like, with a six-lobed corolla. An unripe fruit has a firm outer skin and when picked, releases white chicle from its stem. A fully ripened fruit has saggy skin and does not release chicle when picked.

The fruit is a large berry, 4-8 cm (1.6-3.1 in) in diameter. Inside, its flesh ranges from a pale yellow to an earthy brown color with a grainy texture akin to that of a well-ripened pear. Each fruit contains one to six seeds.The seeds are hard, glossy, and black, resembling beans, with a hook at one end that can catch in the throat if swallowed.

The fruit has an exceptionally sweet, malty flavor. The unripe fruit is hard to the touch and contains high amounts of saponin, which has astringent properties similar to tannin, drying out the mouth.

The trees can survive only in warm, typically tropical environments, dying easily if the temperature drops below freezing. From germination, the sapodilla tree will usually take anywhere from five to eight years to bear fruit. The sapodilla trees yield fruit twice a year, though flowering may continue year round</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">Description/Taste
Chikoo has brown fuzzy skin and is more oval-shaped than its Central American cousins, though some develop pointed ends. The skin is inedible, but serves a purpose as a kind of bowl for the sweet flesh. The flesh is off-white to a yellowish brown color and has a soft and juicy texture. The sweet flavor of the Chikoo flesh is due to the presence of high levels of fructose and sucrose. Its texture and flavor has been compared to that of pear. Within the flesh of the Chikoo is a cavity with two to three large black seeds. The seeds are inedible and should be discarded.

Seasons/Availability
Chikoos are harvested twice during the year, once in the mid-winter months and again in the late spring months.

Current Facts
Chikoo, or Manilkara zapota, is the fruit of an evergreen tree native to Central America and grown since ancient times. Most modern cultivation of the Chikoo tree is for the purpose of harvesting 'chicle', a sap from its bark. In India, the tree is cultivated mainly for its fruits. Chikoo, as it is called in India, is also known as a Sapodilla in English or Zapote in Spanish. In the West Indies it is known as the Naseberry.

Nutritional Value
In Ayruvedic practice Chikoo is used for its anti-inflammatory benefits. It is also a good source for dietary fiber. The natural tannins in the flesh of the Chikoo are antioxidants and have antiviral, anti-bacterial, and anti-parasitic effects.

Applications
Chikoos are most often eaten fresh, halved with seeds removed and simply by scooping the flesh from the skin. The pulp is used to make smoothies and shakes, and in various dessert applications as well. Add scooped Chikoo flesh to fruit or green salads or mix with egg custard before baking. A sauce is made from pressing the pulp through a strainer, mixing with juice and topped with whipped cream. Chikoo ripen off the tree and are highly perishable; fresh Chikoo must be eaten within a week.

Ethnic/Cultural Info
On the Western coast of India where Chikoo is abundant, the city of Dahanu holds an annual Chikoo Festival to draw tourists and tropical fruit lovers from around the region.

Geography/History
Chikoo trees are native to Southern Mexico and the Yucatan. They have been grown throughout Central America since ancient times and can also be found growing in the West Indies, Bermuda, the Philippines and the Florida Keyes. India is one of the largest producers of the Chikoo fruit, whereas the trees are grown in Mexico primarily for the chicle extruded from the tree bark and used to make gum. The tree prefers a warm and sunny environment.
